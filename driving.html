                    <p>Did the Jenny lake scenic drive with my family and boy is it scenic. They were not kidding. The lake was absolutely stunning and we stopped by to dip our feet in the water. The only trouble we had was finding some parking.</p>

                    <p>Parking was hard to find if you want to go to the lake but the drive is pretty ordinary. Save yourself some time and skip it. </p>
