        <h2>Surprise and Amphitheather Lakes</h2>
        <p>The trail for Surprise and Amphitheater Lakes is a strenuous, 10.1 mile trail that takes you to two alpine lakes. Park at the Lupine Meadows Trailhead for best access. The trail switchbacks up the mountains for five miles, before reaching Surprise Lake. From there, it's another quarter mile on to Amphitheater Lake. Both lakes offer views of the surrounding peaks, with Amphitheater being situated just below the summit of Disappointment Peak. The trail gains 3,000ft over five miles and can be hazardous for those not acclimated to high altitude. The best cure for altitude sickness is to retreat to a lower elevation.
